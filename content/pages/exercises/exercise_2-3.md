B: Labelling Exercises
----------------------

### The following files may contain

1.  Intonational Phrases with either one or more pitch accents and/or
2.  More than one Intonational Phrase. (Label them using the inventory we've seen so far: H\*, L\*, H-H% and L-L% tones and 0, 1 or 4 breaks.)

    2.  ex3b2banana (_another banana_)

    5.  ex3b5watermelon (_a watermelon_)

C: Further Exercises
--------------------

Make your own recording: Try to produce the same text with varying number and placement of pitch accents. For example, try saying the words _another banana_ in a single Intonational Phrase

*   with a pitch accent on _another_,
*   with a pitch accent on _banana_, and
*   with 2 pitch accents, one on each of the two words. Try varying your pitch accent types between H\* and L\*, as well as your phrase accent-boundary tone combinations.

Here are some combinations you might want to try:

H\* L-L% vs. H\* H\* L-L% and L\* H\* L-L% or, L\* H-H% vs L\* L\* H-H% or H\* L\* H-H%
