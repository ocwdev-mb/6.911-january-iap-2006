Praat Software
--------------

The tutorials and exercises in this course used Praat, a popular program for labeling and displaying ToBI transcriptions. Praat was used to display the utterance waveform, the f0 contour, the spectrogram and the first four tiers for the utterances in the tutorials, as seen in the screenshots.

Praat software, along with additional information, is available for download at [Praat](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/).
